Heatmap is a PowerShell module to help you keep track of the performance of your machines.

A heatmap shows the state of a counter at a glance.

As the situation gets worse, the colors get hotter.

Each item on the heatmap is based off of a performance counter.  

You can find all of the performance counters that output a value from 1 to 100 by using the Get-PercentagePerformanceCounter command.
